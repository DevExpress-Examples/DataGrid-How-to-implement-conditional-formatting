# DataGrid - How to implement conditional formatting

This example demonstrates how to use the [onCellPrepared](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#onCellPrepared) event to implement conditional formatting. The [onCellPrepared](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#onCellPrepared) event handler arguments contains the current grid cell element and grid row data, so that it is possible to modify the appearance of a cell based on the current row values.
